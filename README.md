🃏 Blackjack (Python Terminal Game)
This is a simple Blackjack game I built in Python as part of Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code course. It runs in the terminal and sticks to the basic rules of Blackjack (hit, stand, dealer stops at 17, etc.), but the real purpose was to practice core programming skills in a fun way.

🧰 What I Used
Python (obviously)

random.choice() to simulate card draws

Functions to break logic into clean parts (deal_card(), calculate_score(), compare(), etc.)

Lists to track user and computer hands

If/else logic and while loops to control game flow

Handling special rules (like Ace being 1 or 11, or detecting Blackjack with just 2 cards)

💡 What I Practiced
Writing clean, reusable functions

Handling edge cases (like multiple Aces or busts)

Keeping the code readable and easy to follow

Letting the computer follow game rules automatically

Giving users real-time choices in a loop until the game ends

👀 Why It’s on My GitHub
This project isn’t about fancy graphics — it’s about logic and structure. I wanted to show that I understand how to build a basic game loop, manage state, and write code that works without being messy.

It also shows that I’m comfortable with:

Problem-solving

Thinking through edge cases

Writing beginner-to-intermediate level Python in a way that makes sense

If you’re a recruiter or developer checking out my work, feel free to run the game and test how I handled things like score calculation, the Ace rule, or who wins when both players are close to 21.
